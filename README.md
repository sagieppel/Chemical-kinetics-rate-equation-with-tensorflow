# Chemical-kinetics-rate-equation-with-tensorflow
Chemical kinetics with tensorflow. Use tensorflow deep learning platform to numerically calculate chemical rate equations for chemical kinetic systems with arbitrary number of reactions and components

This code demonstrate the numerical modeling chemical rate equations using tensorflow. Tensorflow is a deep learining platform  with ability to preform vector/tensor operations in parallel and very efficienctly. This can usefull for chemical kinetics systems with large number of parallel reactions and chemical components such as chemical reaction networks. 
I will use standard notations for chemical kinetics described in:
